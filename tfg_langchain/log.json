  "response": "The planning process considers battery efficiency as the primary constraint. The robot starts at `home` with 100 battery, which is also the only charging location. A `move` action costs 20 battery, and an `explain_painting` action costs 10. To return to `home` for a recharge, the robot must have at least 20 battery. Therefore, any trip away from home must be planned so that the robot has 20 battery remaining when it needs to start its journey back.\n\nThe most efficient use of a single battery charge is to perform a sequence of actions that consumes 80 battery, leaving exactly 20 for the return trip. A trip consisting of moving to a location, explaining a painting, moving to a second location, explaining the second painting, and then returning home consumes exactly 80 battery (`move` 20 + `explain` 10 + `move` 20 + `explain` 10 = 60 for the tasks, plus 20 for the return `move`).\n\nThe plan is structured into three full recharge cycles and a final trip to complete the goals.\n\n*   **Trip 1:** The robot travels from `home` to `dibejo` and then to `elgrito`. It explains the paintings at both locations because `(explained_painting dibejo)` and `(explained_painting elgrito)` are goals. After these actions, the battery is at 40. The robot moves back to `home`, arriving with 20 battery, and must recharge.\n*   **Trip 2:** After recharging to 100, the robot travels to `guernica` and `la_joven_de_la_perla`. It explains both paintings as they are required by the goal state. It then returns to `home` with 20 battery and recharges again.\n*   **Trip 3:** The robot travels to `las_meninas` and `el_3_de_mayo_de_1808`, explaining both paintings to satisfy their respective goals. It returns to `home` for its final recharge.\n*   **Final Trip:** The robot uses its last full charge to complete the remaining goals. It travels to `el_jardin_de_las_delicias` and `monalisa`, explaining both as required. Finally, it moves to `nocheestrellada` to satisfy the last `visited` goal.

It returns to `home` for its final recharge.\n*   **Final Trip:** The robot uses its last full charge to complete the remaining goals. It travels to `el_jardin_de_las_delicias` and `monalisa`, explaining both as required. Finally, it moves to `nocheestrellada` to satisfy the last `visited` goal. The plan concludes here as all goals have been met.\n\nPLAN:\n0.000: (start_welcome tiago) [1.000]\n1.001: (move tiago home dibejo) [15.000]\n16.001: (explain_painting tiago dibejo) [15.000]\n31.001: (move tiago dibejo elgrito) [15.000]\n46.001: (explain_painting tiago elgrito) [15.000]\n61.001: (move tiago elgrito home) [15.000]\n76.001: (recharge tiago home) [5.000]\n81.002: (move tiago home guernica) [15.000]\n96.002: (explain_painting tiago guernica) [15.000]\n111.002: (move tiago guernica la_joven_de_la_perla) [15.000]\n126.002: (explain_painting tiago la_joven_de_la_perla) [15.000]\n141.002: (move tiago la_joven_de_la_perla home) [15.000]\n156.002: (recharge tiago home) [5.000]\n161.003: (move tiago home las_meninas) [15.000]\n176.003: (explain_painting tiago las_meninas) [15.000]\n191.003: (move tiago las_meninas el_3_de_mayo_de_1808) [15.000]\n206.003: (explain_painting tiago el_3_de_mayo_de_1808) [15.000]\n221.003: (move tiago el_3_de_mayo_de_1808 home) [15.000]\n236.003: (recharge tiago home) [5.000]\n241.004: (move tiago home el_jardin_de_las_delicias) [15.000]\n256.004: (explain_painting tiago el_jardin_de_las_delicias) [15.000]\n271.004: (move tiago el_jardin_de_las_delicias monalisa) [15.000]\n286.004: (explain_painting tiago monalisa) [15.000]\n301.004: (move tiago monalisa nocheestrellada) [15.000]"

  "response": "The planning process begins by analyzing the robot's initial state (at `home` with 100 battery) and the goals, which involve visiting 4 specific locations and explaining 8 paintings. To explain a painting, the robot must be at its location, so this implicitly adds more locations to the visit list. The total unique locations to visit are 9.\n\nThe core of the strategy is to maximize the work done per battery charge to minimize the number of recharges and trips back to `home`. A `move` action costs 20 battery and an `explain_painting` action costs 10. A trip consisting of moving to a location and explaining it costs 30 battery.\n\nWith a full 100 battery, the robot can perform a sequence like: `move` (to 80), `explain` (to 70), `move` (to 50), `explain` (to 40). At this point, with 40 battery, the robot can make one more `move` (to 20), but will not have enough battery to `explain` and then `move` back home. Therefore, the most efficient trip cycle is to visit and explain two locations, and then use the remaining battery to move back to `home` to recharge. This cycle consumes 80 battery (2 moves, 2 explains, 1 move home) and leaves the robot with 20 battery at `home`, ready to recharge.\n\nThe plan is structured into four main trips:\n\n1.  **First Trip:** The robot starts with 100 battery. It travels to `dibejo` and explains it (a goal). Then it travels to `elgrito`, visits it (a goal), and explains it (another goal). With 40 battery left, it's not enough to visit another location and return, so it must return to `home`. It arrives with 20 battery, which is critically low. A recharge is necessary to continue the mission. The robot recharges back to 100.\n\n2.  **Second Trip:** With a full battery, the robot repeats the efficient cycle. It visits and explains `guernica` (fulfilling two goals), then moves to `la_joven_de_la_perla` and explains it (a goal). Again, it returns to `home` with 20 battery and must recharge to 100.\n\n3.  **Third Trip:** The pattern continues. The robot visits and explains `las_meninas` and `el_3_de_mayo_de_1808`, both of which are goals. It returns to `home` for its third and final necessary recharge.\n\n4.  **Final Trip:** The robot starts at `home` with 100 battery. The remaining tasks are to visit and explain `monalisa` and `el_jardin_de_las_delicias`, and to visit `nocheestrellada`. This requires 3 moves and 2 explanations, costing a total of 80 battery. Since the robot has 100 battery, this can all be accomplished in a single trip without needing to return home. The robot executes these tasks sequentially. After the final move to `nocheestrellada`, all goals have been achieved, and the plan is complete.\n\nThis plan successfully completes all goals using the minimum of three recharges, ensuring no battery is wasted and no unnecessary moves are made.\n\nPLAN:\n0.000: (start_welcome tiago) [1.000]\n1.001: (move tiago home dibejo) [15.000]\n16.002: (explain_painting tiago dibejo) [15.000]\n31.003: (move tiago dibejo elgrito) [15.000]\n46.004: (explain_painting tiago elgrito) [15.000]\n61.005: (move tiago elgrito home) [15.000]\n76.006: (recharge tiago home) [5.000]\n81.007: (move tiago home guernica) [15.000]\n96.008: (explain_painting tiago guernica) [15.000]\n111.009: (move tiago guernica la_joven_de_la_perla) [15.000]\n126.010: (explain_painting tiago la_joven_de_la_perla) [15.000]\n141.011: (move tiago la_joven_de_la_perla home) [15.000]\n156.012: (recharge tiago home) [5.000]\n161.013: (move tiago home las_meninas) [15.000]\n176.014: (explain_painting tiago las_meninas) [15.000]\n191.015: (move tiago las_meninas el_3_de_mayo_de_1808) [15.000]\n206.016: (explain_painting tiago el_3_de_mayo_de_1808) [15.000]\n221.017: (move tiago el_3_de_mayo_de_1808 home) [15.000]\n236.018: (recharge tiago home) [5.000]\n241.019: (move tiago home monalisa) [15.000]\n256.020: (explain_painting tiago monalisa) [15.000]\n271.021: (move tiago monalisa el_jardin_de_las_delicias) [15.000]\n286.022: (explain_painting tiago el_jardin_de_las_delicias) [15.000]\n301.023: (move tiago el_jardin_de_las_delicias nocheestrellada) [15.000]"
