PROMPT:

You are a planner for PDDL and I only want you to give me the execution plan. You need to take into account the following:

1.The robot has a battery that is consumed with each movement and action.
2.The battery must be recharged when necessary, but you should minimize the number of recharges and movements to make the plan as efficient as possible.
3.Maximize efficiency regarding battery usage, performing recharges only when absolutely necessary and only at locations that have chargers.
4.Do not make any comments or additional explanations. I only want the plan.
5.Do not invent actions or make unnecessary actions.

I will provide you with the domain and the problem. The only output I expect from you is the execution plan, as a set of actions, with their start times and durations. The structure of the plan should be the following:

0.000: (start_welcome tiago) [1.000]
1.001: (move tiago home maestro_aprendiz) [15.000]
16.002: (move tiago maestro_aprendiz elgrito) [15.000]
31.002: (explain_painting tiago elgrito) [15.000]
46.002: (move tiago elgrito guernica) [15.000]
...
Now I will provide the domain and the problem. ONLY RESPOND WITH THE PLAN, NOTHING ELSE.

The most important thing in the plan is that you consider the battery.
Starting with 100, moving consumes 20, and explaining consumes 10. Therefore, you must recharge the robot before the battery runs out. If you have 20 battery, the action must be MOVE TO HOME to recharge.

REMEMBER, THE OUTPUT MUST ALWAYS HAVE THIS FORMAT.

PLAN: 
(AND GIVE THE PLAN WITH CORRECT FORMAT)
"

RESPONSE:
To solve this problem, let's analyze the requirements and battery constraints step by step:

**Battery Consumption:**
- Start: 100
- Each MOVE: -20
- Each EXPLAIN: -10
- RECHARGE: sets battery to 100, only at home

**Goals:**
- Visit la_libertad_guiando_al_pueblo
- Explain: guernica, el_3_de_mayo_de_1808, la_rendicion_de_breda, el_jardin_de_las_delicias, la_ultima_cena, la_persistencia_de_la_memoria, el_nacimiento_de_venus

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Start at home (battery 100).**
2. **Plan the most efficient route to visit and explain all required paintings, minimizing moves and recharges.**
3. **Each move costs 20, each explain costs 10.**
4. **You must return to home to recharge before battery is too low to continue.**
5. **Only visit la_libertad_guiando_al_pueblo (no need to explain it).**
6. **Explain the 7 paintings at their locations.**

**Let's assume the following order for efficiency (since no map is given, we will visit each goal location in sequence, then return to home to recharge only when necessary):**

- home → guernica → el_3_de_mayo_de_1808 → la_rendicion_de_breda → el_jardin_de_las_delicias → la_ultima_cena → la_persistencia_de_la_memoria → el_nacimiento_de_venus → la_libertad_guiando_al_pueblo → home (if needed for recharge)

**Battery calculation:**

- home → guernica: move (-20) = 80
- explain guernica (-10) = 70
- move to el_3_de_mayo_de_1808 (-20) = 50
- explain el_3_de_mayo_de_1808 (-10) = 40
- move to la_rendicion_de_breda (-20) = 20
- explain la_rendicion_de_breda (-10) = 10

At this point, battery is 10. Can't move (need 20). Must return to home to recharge before battery is too low. But can't move with 10. So, after explaining la_rendicion_de_breda, battery is 10, can't move. So, after explaining el_3_de_mayo_de_1808, battery is 40, move to home (-20) = 20, recharge.

But that would mean not explaining la_rendicion_de_breda yet. So, let's try to optimize:

**Option 1: After explaining la_rendicion_de_breda, battery is 10, can't move. So, after explaining el_3_de_mayo_de_1808, battery is 40, move to home (-20) = 20, recharge. Then go to la_rendicion_de_breda.**

But that would require extra moves. Let's see if we can do more before recharging.

**Option 2: Try to do 2 explains and 2 moves before recharge:**

- home → guernica: move (-20) = 80
- explain guernica (-10) = 70
- move to el_3_de_mayo_de_1808 (-20) = 50
- explain el_3_de_mayo_de_1808 (-10) = 40
- move to home (-20) = 20
- recharge

Then continue.

**So, the plan is:**
- home → guernica (move, explain)

PROMPT:

You are a planner for PDDL and I only want you to give me the execution plan. You need to take into account the following:

1.The robot has a battery that is consumed with each movement and action.
2.The battery must be recharged when necessary, but you should minimize the number of recharges and movements to make the plan as efficient as possible.
3.Maximize efficiency regarding battery usage, performing recharges only when absolutely necessary and only at locations that have chargers.
4.Do not make any comments or additional explanations. I only want the plan.
5.Do not invent actions or make unnecessary actions.

I will provide you with the domain and the problem. The only output I expect from you is the execution plan, as a set of actions, with their start times and durations. The structure of the plan should be the following:

0.000: (start_welcome tiago) [1.000]
1.001: (move tiago home maestro_aprendiz) [15.000]
16.002: (move tiago maestro_aprendiz elgrito) [15.000]
31.002: (explain_painting tiago elgrito) [15.000]
46.002: (move tiago elgrito guernica) [15.000]
...
Now I will provide the domain and the problem. ONLY RESPOND WITH THE PLAN, NOTHING ELSE.

The most important thing in the plan is that you consider the battery.
Starting with 100, moving consumes 20, and explaining consumes 10. Therefore, you must recharge the robot before the battery runs out. If you have 20 battery, the action must be MOVE TO HOME to recharge.

REMEMBER, THE OUTPUT MUST ALWAYS HAVE THIS FORMAT.

0.000: (start_welcome tiago) [1.000]

Give me de step by step explanation of when you should recharge de robot, when you are planning and explaining a painting,
tell me why you are explaining the drawing and if it was in the goal or not.

MODEL : gpt-4o-mini
PROMPT:

You are a planner for PDDL and I only want you to give me the execution plan. You need to take into account the following:

1.The robot has a battery that is consumed with each movement and action.
2.The battery must be recharged when necessary, but you should minimize the number of recharges and movements to make the plan as efficient as possible.
3.Maximize efficiency regarding battery usage, performing recharges only when absolutely necessary and only at locations that have chargers.
4.Do not make any comments or additional explanations. I only want the plan.
5.Do not invent actions or make unnecessary actions.

I will provide you with the domain and the problem. The only output I expect from you is the execution plan, as a set of actions, with their start times and durations. The structure of the plan should be the following:

0.000: (start_welcome tiago) [1.000]
1.001: (move tiago home maestro_aprendiz) [15.000]
16.002: (move tiago maestro_aprendiz elgrito) [15.000]
31.002: (explain_painting tiago elgrito) [15.000]
46.002: (move tiago elgrito guernica) [15.000]
...
Now I will provide the domain and the problem. ONLY RESPOND WITH THE PLAN, NOTHING ELSE.

The most important thing in the plan is that you consider the battery.
Starting with 100, moving consumes 20, and explaining consumes 10. Therefore, you must recharge the robot before the battery runs out. If you have 20 battery, the action must be MOVE TO HOME to recharge.

REMEMBER, THE OUTPUT MUST ALWAYS HAVE THIS FORMAT.

You are a planner for PDDL and I only want you to give me the execution plan. You need to take into account the following:

1.The robot has a battery that is consumed with each movement and action.
2.The battery must be recharged when necessary, but you should minimize the number of recharges and movements to make the plan as efficient as possible.
3.Maximize efficiency regarding battery usage, performing recharges only when absolutely necessary and only at locations that have chargers.
4.Do not make any comments or additional explanations. I only want the plan.
5.Do not invent actions or make unnecessary actions.

I will provide you with the domain and the problem. The only output I expect from you is the execution plan, as a set of actions, with their start times and durations. The structure of the plan should be the following:

0.000: (start_welcome tiago) [1.000]
1.001: (move tiago home maestro_aprendiz) [15.000]

The most important thing in the plan is that you consider the battery.
Starting with 100, moving consumes 20, and explaining consumes 10. Therefore, you must recharge the robot before the battery runs out. If you have 20 battery, the action must be MOVE TO HOME to recharge.

REMEMBER, THE OUTPUT MUST ALWAYS HAVE THIS FORMAT.

The most important thing in the plan is that you consider the battery.
Starting with 100, moving consumes 20, and explaining consumes 10. Therefore, you must recharge the robot before the battery runs out. If you have 20 battery, the action must be MOVE TO HOME to recharge.

REMEMBER, THE OUTPUT MUST ALWAYS HAVE THIS FORMAT.

0.000: (start_welcome tiago) [1.000]
1.001: (move tiago home maestro_aprendiz) [15.000]
16.002: (move tiago maestro_aprendiz elgrito) [15.000]
31.002: (explain_painting tiago elgrito) [15.000]
46.002: (move tiago elgrito guernica) [15.000]


Give me de step by step explanation of when you should recharge de robot, when you are planning and explaining a painting,
tell me why you are explaining the drawing and if it was in the goal or not. 

But at the end do:
"
PLAN: 
(AND GIVE THE PLAN WITH CORRECT FORMAT)
"

RESPONSE:
The plan is designed to be as efficient as possible, minimizing movements and recharges by carefully managing the robot's battery. The robot, Tiago, starts with 100 battery units at `home`, the only charging location. A `move` costs 20 units and an `explain_painting` costs 10.

The strategy involves executing "tours" where Tiago leaves `home`, completes as many tasks as possible, and returns to recharge just as the battery is about to run out. An optimal tour involves using exactly 100 battery units, which typically allows for visiting three locations, explaining two paintings, and then returning to `home`.

**Tour 1:**
The robot begins by traveling to `maestro_aprendiz` and `elgrito`.
- **Why explain at `maestro_aprendiz` and `elgrito`?** These actions are performed because `(explained_painting maestro_aprendiz)` and `(explained_painting elgrito)` are required goals in the problem definition. The robot explains them upon arrival to be efficient.
- After these tasks, the robot moves to `guernica`, leaving it with 20 battery units.
- **When to recharge?** The robot must recharge now. With only 20 battery, it has just enough energy for one final `move`. To avoid being stranded, this move must be back to `home`. Upon arrival with 0 battery, it recharges to 100.

**Tour 2:**
With a full battery, the robot starts its second tour.
- It first travels to `guernica` to fulfill the `(explained_painting guernica)` goal, which couldn't be done in the previous tour due to low battery.
- It then proceeds to `la_joven_de_la_perla` and explains it, as this is another required goal.
- Following the same battery logic, after moving to `las_meninas`, the battery is down to 20, necessitating a return trip to `home` for a second recharge.

**Tour 3:**
This tour continues the pattern.
- Tiago leaves `home` to accomplish the goals of explaining at `las_meninas` and `el_3_de_mayo_de_1808`, as both were specified in the problem's goal state.
- After a final move to `el_jardin_de_las_delicias`, the battery is again at the critical 20-unit level, forcing a return to `home` for the third recharge.

**Final Tour:**
The last set of tasks is completed in this tour.
- The remaining goals are to explain at `el_jardin_de_las_delicias` and `monalisa`, and to visit `monalisa` and `nocheestrellada`. All of these are part of the problem's goal definition.
- The robot travels to `el_jardin_de_las_delicias` and `monalisa`, explaining at both locations.
- After explaining at `monalisa`, the battery is at 40. This is enough for two more moves. The final goal is to visit `nocheestrellada`, so the robot moves there directly, completing all objectives. The plan ends with the robot at `nocheestrellada`, as no further actions are required.

You are a planner for PDDL and I only want you to give me the execution plan. You need to take into account the following:

1.The robot has a battery that is consumed with each movement and action.
2.The battery must be recharged when necessary, but you should minimize the number of recharges and movements to make the plan as efficient as possible.
3.Maximize efficiency regarding battery usage, performing recharges only when absolutely necessary and only at locations that have chargers.
4.Do not make any comments or additional explanations. I only want the plan.
5.Do not invent actions or make unnecessary actions.

I will provide you with the domain and the problem. The only output I expect from you is the execution plan, as a set of actions, with their start times and durations. The structure of the plan should be the following:

PROMPT:

You are a planner for PDDL and I only want you to give me the execution plan. You need to take into account the following:

1.The robot has a battery that is consumed with each movement and action.
2.The battery must be recharged when necessary, but you should minimize the number of recharges and movements to make the plan as efficient as possible.
3.Maximize efficiency regarding battery usage, performing recharges only when absolutely necessary and only at locations that have chargers.
4.Do not make any comments or additional explanations. I only want the plan.
5.Do not invent actions or make unnecessary actions.

I will provide you with the domain and the problem. The only output I expect from you is the execution plan, as a set of actions, with their start times and durations. The structure of the plan should be the following:

0.000: (start_welcome tiago) [1.000]

RESPONSE:
**Explanation of the Planning Process:**

The planning process aims to achieve all specified goals while adhering to battery constraints and minimizing recharges and movements.

**Initial State:** The robot `tiago` starts at `home` with a full battery of 100 units. `home` is the only location equipped with a charger.

**Action Costs and Battery Management Strategy:**
*   `move` action: Consumes 20 battery units and has a duration of 15. It requires at least 20 battery units to start.
*   `explain_painting` action: Consumes 10 battery units and has a duration of 15. It requires at least 10 battery units to start.
*   `recharge` action: Restores battery to 100 units and has a duration of 5. It can only be performed at a location with a charger (in this case, `home`).

To maximize efficiency and minimize recharges, the robot plans its actions in "trips" from `home`. A single trip can optimally include:
1.  A `move` from `home` to a first painting location (e.g., `L1`). (Cost: 20 battery)
2.  An `explain_painting` action at `L1`. (Cost: 10 battery)
3.  A `move` from `L1` to a second painting location (e.g., `L2`). (Cost: 20 battery)
4.  An `explain_painting` action at `L2`. (Cost: 10 battery)
5.  A `move` from `L2` back to `home`. (Cost: 20 battery)

This sequence consumes a total of 20 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 20 = 80 battery units. Starting with 100 battery, the robot would have 20 battery units remaining upon returning to `home`. Since a `move` action requires at least 20 battery units, this strategy ensures the robot always has enough power for the return trip to `home` for recharging, without risking being stranded. This allows for two explanations per trip before a mandatory recharge.

**Goal Breakdown and Execution:**

The goals are to explain 8 specific paintings and visit 1 specific painting (`nocheestrellada`). The plan is structured into several trips, each maximizing the number of actions before returning to `home` for a recharge.

**Trip 1: Monalisa and El Grito**
*   **Initial Battery:** 100 (after `start_welcome`).
*   **Actions:**
    *   Move from `home` to `monalisa`. (Battery: 100 -> 80)
    *   Explain `monalisa`. This painting is a goal (`explained_painting monalisa`, `visited tiago monalisa`). (Battery: 80 -> 70)
    *   Move from `monalisa` to `elgrito`. (Battery: 70 -> 50)
    *   Explain `elgrito`. This painting is a goal (`explained_painting elgrito`, `visited tiago elgrito`). (Battery: 50 -> 40)
*   **Recharge Decision:** At `elgrito`, battery is 40. To return to `home` for recharge, a `move` costs 20, leaving 20 battery. This is the optimal point to recharge.
*   **Actions:**
    *   Move from `elgrito` to `home`. (Battery: 40 -> 20)
    *   Recharge at `home`. (Battery: 20 -> 100)

**Trip 2: Maestro Aprendiz and Guernica**
*   **Initial Battery:** 100.
*   **Actions:**
    *   Move from `home` to `maestro_aprendiz`. (Battery: 100 -> 80)
    *   Explain `maestro_aprendiz`. This painting is a goal (`explained_painting maestro_aprendiz`). (Battery: 80 -> 70)
    *   Move from `maestro_aprendiz` to `guernica`. (Battery: 70 -> 50)
    *   Explain `guernica`. This painting is a goal (`explained_painting guernica`, `visited tiago guernica`). (Battery: 50 -> 40)
*   **Recharge Decision:** At `guernica`, battery is 40. Optimal to return to `home` for recharge.
*   **Actions:**
    *   Move from `guernica` to `home`. (Battery: 40 -> 20)
    *   Recharge at `home`. (Battery: 20 -> 100)

**Trip 3: La Joven de la Perla and Las Meninas**
*   **Initial Battery:** 100.
*   **Actions:**
    *   Move from `home` to `la_joven_de_la_perla`. (Battery: 100 -> 80)
    *   Explain `la_joven_de_la_perla`. This painting is a goal (`explained_painting la_joven_de_la_perla`). (Battery: 80 -> 70)
    *   Move from `la_joven_de_la_perla` to `las_meninas`. (Battery: 70 -> 50)
    *   Explain `las_meninas`. This painting is a goal (`explained_painting las_meninas`). (Battery: 50 -> 40)
*   **Recharge Decision:** At `las_meninas`, battery is 40. Optimal to return to `home` for recharge.
*   **Actions:**
    *   Move from `las_meninas` to `home`. (Battery: 40 -> 20)
    *   Recharge at `home`. (Battery: 20 -> 100)

**Trip 4: El 3 de Mayo de 1808 and El Jardin de las Delicias**
*   **Initial Battery:** 100.
*   **Actions:**
    *   Move from `home` to `el_3_de_mayo_de_1808`. (Battery: 100 -> 80)
    *   Explain `el_3_de_mayo_de_1808`. This painting is a goal (`explained_painting el_3_de_mayo_de_1808`). (Battery: 80 -> 70)
    *   Move from `el_3_de_mayo_de_1808` to `el_jardin_de_las_delicias`. (Battery: 70 -> 50)
    *   Explain `el_jardin_de_las_delicias`. This painting is a goal (`explained_painting el_jardin_de_las_delicias`). (Battery: 50 -> 40)
*   **Recharge Decision:** At `el_jardin_de_las_delicias`, battery is 40. Optimal to return to `home` for recharge.
*   **Actions:**
    *   Move from `el_jardin_de_las_delicias` to `home`. (Battery: 40 -> 20)
    *   Recharge at `home`. (Battery: 20 -> 100)

**Trip 5: Noche Estrellada (Visit Only)**
*   **Initial Battery:** 100.
*   **Actions:**
    *   Move from `home` to `nocheestrellada`. This location is a goal (`visited tiago nocheestrellada`). No explanation is required. (Battery: 100 -> 80)
    *   Move from `nocheestrellada` to `home`. (Battery: 80 -> 60)
*   **Final State:** All goals are met. The robot is at `home` with 60 battery, which is sufficient as no further actions are needed.

This plan ensures all goals are met, battery levels are managed efficiently, and recharges are performed only when necessary to complete the next set of tasks.

The most important thing in the plan is that you consider the battery.
Starting with 100, moving consumes 20, and explaining consumes 10. Therefore, you must recharge the robot before the battery runs out. If you have 20 battery, the action must be MOVE TO HOME to recharge.

REMEMBER, THE OUTPUT MUST ALWAYS HAVE THIS FORMAT.

The most important thing in the plan is that you consider the battery.
Starting with 100, moving consumes 20, and explaining consumes 10. Therefore, you must recharge the robot before the battery runs out. If you have 20 battery, the action must be MOVE TO HOME to recharge.

REMEMBER, THE OUTPUT MUST ALWAYS HAVE THIS FORMAT.

PLAN: 
(AND GIVE THE PLAN WITH CORRECT FORMAT)
"

RESPONSE:
Here is a step-by-step explanation of the plan, focusing on battery management and goal achievement.

The robot, Tiago, starts at `home` with a full battery of 100. The `home` location is the only place with a charger. A `move` action costs 20 battery, and an `explain_painting` action costs 10. To be able to move, the robot must have at least 20 battery. The plan is structured into "trips" from the charging station to maximize the work done per battery charge.

**Trip 1: Addressing the first set of goals.**
*   The robot starts by moving from `home` to `maestro_aprendiz`. Battery drops to 80.
*   It performs `explain_painting` at `maestro_aprendiz`. This is a direct goal of the problem. Battery drops to 70.
*   Next, it moves to `elgrito`. Battery drops to 50. This move helps achieve the `(visited tiago elgrito)` goal.
*   It performs `explain_painting` at `elgrito`. This is a direct goal of the problem. Battery drops to 40.
*   It then moves to `guernica`. Battery drops to 20. This move achieves the `(visited tiago guernica)` goal.
*   **Recharge Decision:** At this point, the battery is at 20. The robot cannot explain the painting at `guernica` (which costs 10) because it would be left with 10 battery, which is insufficient to move back to the charger. Therefore, the most efficient action is to immediately return to `home` to recharge. The move back to `home` consumes the remaining 20 battery.
*   Once at `home`, the `recharge` action is performed, restoring the battery to 100.

**Trip 2: Continuing with the pending goals.**
*   With a full battery, the robot travels back to `guernica`. Battery drops to 80.
*   It now performs the `explain_painting` action at `guernica`, which was a required goal. Battery drops to 70.
*   It moves to `la_joven_de_la_perla`. Battery drops to 50.
*   It explains the painting at `la_joven_de_la_perla`, another goal. Battery drops to 40.
*   It moves to `las_meninas`. Battery drops to 20.
*   **Recharge Decision:** The situation is identical to the end of the first trip. The battery is at the minimum level required for movement (20), so the robot must return to `home` to recharge before it can perform the explanation at `las_meninas`. It moves to `home` and recharges to 100.

**Trip 3: Addressing the next set of goals.**
*   The robot returns to `las_meninas` with a full battery. Battery drops to 80.
*   It explains the painting at `las_meninas` to satisfy that goal. Battery drops to 70.
*   It moves to `el_3_de_mayo_de_1808`. Battery drops to 50.
*   It explains the painting at `el_3_de_mayo_de_1808`, a required goal. Battery drops to 40.
*   It moves to `el_jardin_de_las_delicias`. Battery drops to 20.
*   **Recharge Decision:** Again, with 20 battery, the only viable option is to return to `home` and recharge to 100.

**Trip 4: Completing the final goals.**
*   The robot returns to `el_jardin_de_las_delicias`. Battery drops to 80.
*   It explains the painting, fulfilling that goal. Battery drops to 70.
*   It moves to `monalisa`. Battery drops to 50. This achieves the `(visited tiago monalisa)` goal.
*   It explains the painting at `monalisa`, another goal. Battery drops to 40.
*   Finally, it moves to `nocheestrellada`. Battery drops to 20. This move achieves the last goal, `(visited tiago nocheestrellada)`.
*   Since all goals are now met, the plan is complete. The robot does not need to return home.

PLAN: 
(AND GIVE THE PLAN WITH CORRECT FORMAT)
"

RESPONSE:
The planning process begins with the robot `tiago` at the `home` location with a full battery of 100 units. The objective is to visit four specific locations and explain eight paintings, while managing the battery efficiently.

The first action is `start_welcome`, which is a necessary initialization step and does not consume battery.

**Trip 1:**
With a full battery, the robot plans its first trip to accomplish as many goals as possible.
1.  It moves from `home` to `maestro_aprendiz`. This is to reach the location of a painting that needs to be explained, which is a goal. The move consumes 20 battery, leaving 80.
2.  At `maestro_aprendiz`, it performs `explain_painting`. This action fulfills the goal `(explained_painting maestro_aprendiz)` and consumes 10 battery, leaving 70.
3.  Next, it moves to `elgrito`. Both visiting and explaining this location are goals. The move consumes 20 battery, leaving 50.
4.  At `elgrito`, it explains the painting, fulfilling the goals `(visited tiago elgrito)` and `(explained_painting elgrito)`. This consumes 10 battery, leaving 40.
5.  The robot then moves to `guernica`, another location that must be visited and explained. The move consumes 20 battery, leaving 20.
6.  At this point, the battery is at 20. This is the minimum required to execute a `move` action. The robot cannot explain the painting at `guernica` (which costs 10 battery) because it would then be left with 10 battery, insufficient to move again. Therefore, to avoid getting stranded, the robot must return to the charging station. It moves from `guernica` back to `home`, consuming the remaining 20 battery.
7.  At `home`, with 0 battery, the robot must `recharge`. This action restores the battery to 100, preparing it for the next trip.

**Trip 2:**
The robot starts again from `home` with a full battery.
1.  Its first destination is `guernica`, the location it visited on the previous trip but could not explain due to low battery. The move consumes 20 battery, leaving 80.
2.  At `guernica`, it explains the painting, fulfilling the goal `(explained_painting guernica)`. This consumes 10 battery, leaving 70.
3.  Following the same efficient pattern, it moves to `monalisa` (cost 20, battery 50) and explains it (cost 10, battery 40), fulfilling the goals `(visited tiago monalisa)` and `(explained_painting monalisa)`.
4.  It then moves to `la_joven_de_la_perla` (cost 20, battery 20).
5.  Again, the battery is at the critical level of 20, forcing a return to `home` to recharge before explaining the painting. The move to `home` consumes the last 20 battery.
6.  The robot recharges at `home`, restoring the battery to 100.

**Trip 3:**
The third trip follows the established pattern.
1.  The robot travels from `home` back to `la_joven_de_la_perla` (cost 20, battery 80) and explains it (cost 10, battery 70), fulfilling the goal `(explained_painting la_joven_de_la_perla)`.
2.  It continues to `las_meninas`, moving (cost 20, battery 50) and explaining (cost 10, battery 40) to fulfill the goal `(explained_painting las_meninas)`.
3.  It then moves to `el_3_de_mayo_de_1808` (cost 20, battery 20).
4.  Once more, the battery level dictates a return to `home` for a recharge. The move consumes the last 20 battery.
5.  The robot recharges, bringing the battery back to 100.

**Trip 4:**
This is the final trip to complete the remaining goals.
1.  The robot moves from `home` to `el_3_de_mayo_de_1808` (cost 20, battery 80) and explains it (cost 10, battery 70), fulfilling the goal `(explained_painting el_3_de_mayo_de_1808)`.
2.  It then moves to `el_jardin_de_las_delicias` (cost 20, battery 50) and explains it (cost 10, battery 40), fulfilling the goal `(explained_painting el_jardin_de_las_delicias)`.
3.  The final goal is to visit `nocheestrellada`. The robot moves from its current location to `nocheestrellada`, consuming 20 battery and leaving 20. This action fulfills the last goal, `(visited tiago nocheestrellada)`.
All goals have now been achieved, and the plan is complete.

The most important thing in the plan is that you consider the battery.
Starting with 100, moving consumes 20, and explaining consumes 10. Therefore, you must recharge the robot before the battery runs out. If you have 20 battery, the action must be MOVE TO HOME to recharge.

REMEMBER, THE OUTPUT MUST ALWAYS HAVE THIS FORMAT.

0.000: (start_welcome tiago) [1.000]
1.001: (move tiago home maestro_aprendiz) [15.000]
16.002: (move tiago maestro_aprendiz elgrito) [15.000]
31.002: (explain_painting tiago elgrito) [15.000]
46.002: (move tiago elgrito guernica) [15.000]


Give me de step by step explanation of when you should recharge de robot, when you are planning and explaining a painting,
tell me why you are explaining the drawing and if it was in the goal or not.

RESPONSE:

==================================================

MODEL : openai/gpt-oss-20b
PROMPT:

You are a planner for PDDL and I only want you to give me the execution plan. You need to take into account the following:

1.The robot has a battery that is consumed with each movement and action.
2.The battery must be recharged when necessary, but you should minimize the number of recharges and movements to make the plan as efficient as possible.
3.Maximize efficiency regarding battery usage, performing recharges only when absolutely necessary and only at locations that have chargers.
4.Do not make any comments or additional explanations. I only want the plan.
5.Do not invent actions or make unnecessary actions.

I will provide you with the domain and the problem. The only output I expect from you is the execution plan, as a set of actions, with their start times and durations. The structure of the plan should be the following:

0.000: (start_welcome tiago) [1.000]
1.001: (move tiago home maestro_aprendiz) [15.000]
16.002: (move tiago maestro_aprendiz elgrito) [15.000]

The most important thing in the plan is that you consider the battery.
Starting with 100, moving consumes 20, and explaining consumes 10. Therefore, you must recharge the robot before the battery runs out. If you have 20 battery, the action must be MOVE TO HOME to recharge.

REMEMBER, THE OUTPUT MUST ALWAYS HAVE THIS FORMAT.

0.000: (start_welcome tiago) [1.000]
1.001: (move tiago home maestro_aprendiz) [15.000]
16.002: (move tiago maestro_aprendiz elgrito) [15.000]

(AND GIVE THE PLAN WITH CORRECT FORMAT)
"

RESPONSE:
The robot starts with a full battery of 100 units.  
It visits the required locations in the following order, explaining the paintings that are part of the goal and recharging only when the battery would otherwise be insufficient for the next move.  

1. **Home → Monalisa** – battery drops to 80.  
2. **Explain Monalisa** – battery drops to 70 (Monalisa is in the goal).  
3. **Monalisa → Elgrito** – battery drops to 50.  
4. **Explain Elgrito** – battery drops to 40 (Elgrito is in the goal).  
5. **Elgrito → Home** – battery drops to 20.  
6. **Recharge at Home** – battery restored to 100.  

7. **Home → Maestro_aprendiz** – battery drops to 80.  
8. **Explain Maestro_aprendiz** – battery drops to 70 (Maestro_aprendiz is in the goal).  
9. **Maestro_aprendiz → Guernica** – battery drops to 50.  
10. **Explain Guernica** – battery drops to 40 (Guernica is in the goal).  
11. **Guernica → Home** – battery drops to 20.  
12. **Recharge at Home** – battery restored to 100.  

13. **Home → La_joven_de_la_perla** – battery drops to 80.  
14. **Explain La_joven_de_la_perla** – battery drops to 70 (La_joven_de_la_perla is in the goal).  
15. **La_joven_de_la_perla → Las_meninas** – battery drops to 50.  
16. **Explain Las_meninas** – battery drops to 40 (Las_meninas is in the goal).  
17. **Las_meninas → Home** – battery drops to 20.  
18. **Recharge at Home** – battery restored to 100.  

19. **Home → El_3_de_mayo_de_1808** – battery drops to 80.  
20. **Explain El_3_de_mayo_de_1808** – battery drops to 70 (El_3_de_mayo_de_1808 is in the goal).  
21. **El_3_de_mayo_de_1808 → El_jardin_de_las_delicias** – battery drops to 50.  
22. **Explain El_jardin_de_las_delicias** – battery drops to 40 (El_jardin_de_las_delicias is in the goal).  
23. **El_jardin_de_las_delicias → Home** – battery drops to 20.  
24. **Recharge at Home** – battery restored to 100.  

25. **Home → Nocheestrellada** – battery drops to 80.  
   (Nocheestrellada is visited but not explained, as it is not required in the goal.)

The plan uses four recharges, the minimum needed to keep the battery above the 20‑unit threshold required for each move. All goal predicates are satisfied.

PLAN: 
(AND GIVE THE PLAN WITH CORRECT FORMAT)
"

RESPONSE:
Here is a step-by-step explanation of the plan, focusing on battery management and goal achievement.

The robot, Tiago, starts at `home` with a full battery of 100. The `home` location is the only place with a charger. A `move` action costs 20 battery, and an `explain_painting` action costs 10. To be able to move, the robot must have at least 20 battery. The plan is structured into "trips" from the charging station to maximize the work done per battery charge.

**Trip 1: Addressing the first set of goals.**
*   The robot starts by moving from `home` to `maestro_aprendiz`. Battery drops to 80.
*   It performs `explain_painting` at `maestro_aprendiz`. This is a direct goal of the problem. Battery drops to 70.
*   Next, it moves to `elgrito`. Battery drops to 50. This move helps achieve the `(visited tiago elgrito)` goal.
*   It performs `explain_painting` at `elgrito`. This is a direct goal of the problem. Battery drops to 40.
*   It then moves to `guernica`. Battery drops to 20. This move achieves the `(visited tiago guernica)` goal.
*   **Recharge Decision:** At this point, the battery is at 20. The robot cannot explain the painting at `guernica` (which costs 10) because it would be left with 10 battery, which is insufficient to move back to the charger. Therefore, the most efficient action is to immediately return to `home` to recharge. The move back to `home` consumes the remaining 20 battery.
*   Once at `home`, the `recharge` action is performed, restoring the battery to 100.

**Trip 2: Continuing with the pending goals.**
*   With a full battery, the robot travels back to `guernica`. Battery drops to 80.
*   It now performs the `explain_painting` action at `guernica`, which was a required goal. Battery drops to 70.
*   It moves to `la_joven_de_la_perla`. Battery drops to 50.
*   It explains the painting at `la_joven_de_la_perla`, another goal. Battery drops to 40.
*   It moves to `las_meninas`. Battery drops to 20.
*   **Recharge Decision:** The situation is identical to the end of the first trip. The battery is at the minimum level required for movement (20), so the robot must return to `home` to recharge before it can perform the explanation at `las_meninas`. It moves to `home` and recharges to 100.

**Trip 3: Addressing the next set of goals.**
*   The robot returns to `las_meninas` with a full battery. Battery drops to 80.
*   It explains the painting at `las_meninas` to satisfy that goal. Battery drops to 70.
*   It moves to `el_3_de_mayo_de_1808`. Battery drops to 50.
*   It explains the painting at `el_3_de_mayo_de_1808`, a required goal. Battery drops to 40.
*   It moves to `el_jardin_de_las_delicias`. Battery drops to 20.
*   **Recharge Decision:** Again, with 20 battery, the only viable option is to return to `home` and recharge to 100.

**Trip 4: Completing the final goals.**
*   The robot returns to `el_jardin_de_las_delicias`. Battery drops to 80.
*   It explains the painting, fulfilling that goal. Battery drops to 70.
*   It moves to `monalisa`. Battery drops to 50. This achieves the `(visited tiago monalisa)` goal.
*   It explains the painting at `monalisa`, another goal. Battery drops to 40.
*   Finally, it moves to `nocheestrellada`. Battery drops to 20. This move achieves the last goal, `(visited tiago nocheestrellada)`.
*   Since all goals are now met, the plan is complete. The robot does not need to return home.

Starting with 100, moving consumes 20, and explaining consumes 10. Therefore, you must recharge the robot before the battery runs out. If you have 20 battery, the action must be MOVE TO HOME to recharge.

REMEMBER, THE OUTPUT MUST ALWAYS HAVE THIS FORMAT.

RESPONSE:
The planning process begins with the robot `tiago` at the `home` location with a full battery of 100 units. The objective is to visit four specific locations and explain eight paintings, while managing the battery efficiently.

The first action is `start_welcome`, which is a necessary initialization step and does not consume battery.

**Trip 1:**
With a full battery, the robot plans its first trip to accomplish as many goals as possible.
1.  It moves from `home` to `maestro_aprendiz`. This is to reach the location of a painting that needs to be explained, which is a goal. The move consumes 20 battery, leaving 80.
2.  At `maestro_aprendiz`, it performs `explain_painting`. This action fulfills the goal `(explained_painting maestro_aprendiz)` and consumes 10 battery, leaving 70.
3.  Next, it moves to `elgrito`. Both visiting and explaining this location are goals. The move consumes 20 battery, leaving 50.
4.  At `elgrito`, it explains the painting, fulfilling the goals `(visited tiago elgrito)` and `(explained_painting elgrito)`. This consumes 10 battery, leaving 40.
5.  The robot then moves to `guernica`, another location that must be visited and explained. The move consumes 20 battery, leaving 20.
6.  At this point, the battery is at 20. This is the minimum required to execute a `move` action. The robot cannot explain the painting at `guernica` (which costs 10 battery) because it would then be left with 10 battery, insufficient to move again. Therefore, to avoid getting stranded, the robot must return to the charging station. It moves from `guernica` back to `home`, consuming the remaining 20 battery.
7.  At `home`, with 0 battery, the robot must `recharge`. This action restores the battery to 100, preparing it for the next trip.

**Trip 2:**
The robot starts again from `home` with a full battery.
1.  Its first destination is `guernica`, the location it visited on the previous trip but could not explain due to low battery. The move consumes 20 battery, leaving 80.
2.  At `guernica`, it explains the painting, fulfilling the goal `(explained_painting guernica)`. This consumes 10 battery, leaving 70.
3.  Following the same efficient pattern, it moves to `monalisa` (cost 20, battery 50) and explains it (cost 10, battery 40), fulfilling the goals `(visited tiago monalisa)` and `(explained_painting monalisa)`.
4.  It then moves to `la_joven_de_la_perla` (cost 20, battery 20).
5.  Again, the battery is at the critical level of 20, forcing a return to `home` to recharge before explaining the painting. The move to `home` consumes the last 20 battery.
6.  The robot recharges at `home`, restoring the battery to 100.

**Trip 3:**
The third trip follows the established pattern.
1.  The robot travels from `home` back to `la_joven_de_la_perla` (cost 20, battery 80) and explains it (cost 10, battery 70), fulfilling the goal `(explained_painting la_joven_de_la_perla)`.
2.  It continues to `las_meninas`, moving (cost 20, battery 50) and explaining (cost 10, battery 40) to fulfill the goal `(explained_painting las_meninas)`.
3.  It then moves to `el_3_de_mayo_de_1808` (cost 20, battery 20).
4.  Once more, the battery level dictates a return to `home` for a recharge. The move consumes the last 20 battery.
5.  The robot recharges, bringing the battery back to 100.

**Trip 4:**
This is the final trip to complete the remaining goals.
1.  The robot moves from `home` to `el_3_de_mayo_de_1808` (cost 20, battery 80) and explains it (cost 10, battery 70), fulfilling the goal `(explained_painting el_3_de_mayo_de_1808)`.
2.  It then moves to `el_jardin_de_las_delicias` (cost 20, battery 50) and explains it (cost 10, battery 40), fulfilling the goal `(explained_painting el_jardin_de_las_delicias)`.
3.  The final goal is to visit `nocheestrellada`. The robot moves from its current location to `nocheestrellada`, consuming 20 battery and leaving 20. This action fulfills the last goal, `(visited tiago nocheestrellada)`.
All goals have now been achieved, and the plan is complete.

The most important thing in the plan is that you consider the battery.
Starting with 100, moving consumes 20, and explaining consumes 10. Therefore, you must recharge the robot before the battery runs out. If you have 20 battery, the action must be MOVE TO HOME to recharge.

REMEMBER, THE OUTPUT MUST ALWAYS HAVE THIS FORMAT.

==================================================

MODEL : gemini-2.5-pro
PROMPT:

You are a planner for PDDL and I only want you to give me the execution plan. You need to take into account the following:

1.The robot has a battery that is consumed with each movement and action.
2.The battery must be recharged when necessary, but you should minimize the number of recharges and movements to make the plan as efficient as possible.
3.Maximize efficiency regarding battery usage, performing recharges only when absolutely necessary and only at locations that have chargers.
4.Do not make any comments or additional explanations. I only want the plan.
5.Do not invent actions or make unnecessary actions.

I will provide you with the domain and the problem. The only output I expect from you is the execution plan, as a set of actions, with their start times and durations. The structure of the plan should be the following:

0.000: (start_welcome tiago) [1.000]
1.001: (move tiago home maestro_aprendiz) [15.000]
16.002: (move tiago maestro_aprendiz elgrito) [15.000]
31.002: (explain_painting tiago elgrito) [15.000]
46.002: (move tiago elgrito guernica) [15.000]
...
Now I will provide the domain and the problem. ONLY RESPOND WITH THE PLAN, NOTHING ELSE.

PROMPT:

You are a planner for PDDL and I only want you to give me the execution plan. You need to take into account the following:

1.The robot has a battery that is consumed with each movement and action.
2.The battery must be recharged when necessary, but you should minimize the number of recharges and movements to make the plan as efficient as possible.
3.Maximize efficiency regarding battery usage, performing recharges only when absolutely necessary and only at locations that have chargers.
4.Do not make any comments or additional explanations. I only want the plan.
5.Do not invent actions or make unnecessary actions.

I will provide you with the domain and the problem. The only output I expect from you is the execution plan, as a set of actions, with their start times and durations. The structure of the plan should be the following:

0.000: (start_welcome tiago) [1.000]
1.001: (move tiago home maestro_aprendiz) [15.000]
16.002: (move tiago maestro_aprendiz elgrito) [15.000]

The most important thing in the plan is that you consider the battery.
Starting with 100, moving consumes 20, and explaining consumes 10. Therefore, you must recharge the robot before the battery runs out. If you have 20 battery, the action must be MOVE TO HOME to recharge.

REMEMBER, THE OUTPUT MUST ALWAYS HAVE THIS FORMAT.

     The most important thing in the plan is that you consider the battery.
    Starting with 100, moving consumes 20, and explaining consumes 10. Therefore, you must recharge the robot before the battery runs out. If you have 20 battery, the action must be MOVE TO HOME to recharge.

    REMEMBER, THE OUTPUT MUST ALWAYS HAVE THIS FORMAT.

    Give me de step by step explanation of when you should recharge de robot, when you are planning and explaining a painting,
    tell me why you are explaining the drawing and if it was in the goal or not.
