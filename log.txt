PROMPT:

You are a planner for PDDL and I only want you to give me the execution plan. You need to take into account the following:

1.The robot has a battery that is consumed with each movement and action.
2.The battery must be recharged when necessary, but you should minimize the number of recharges and movements to make the plan as efficient as possible.
3.Maximize efficiency regarding battery usage, performing recharges only when absolutely necessary and only at locations that have chargers.
4.Do not make any comments or additional explanations. I only want the plan.
5.Do not invent actions or make unnecessary actions.

I will provide you with the domain and the problem. The only output I expect from you is the execution plan, as a set of actions, with their start times and durations. The structure of the plan should be the following:

0.000: (start_welcome tiago) [1.000]
1.001: (move tiago home maestro_aprendiz) [15.000]
16.002: (move tiago maestro_aprendiz elgrito) [15.000]
31.002: (explain_painting tiago elgrito) [15.000]
46.002: (move tiago elgrito guernica) [15.000]
...
Now I will provide the domain and the problem. ONLY RESPOND WITH THE PLAN, NOTHING ELSE.

The most important thing in the plan is that you consider the battery.
Starting with 100, moving consumes 20, and explaining consumes 10. Therefore, you must recharge the robot before the battery runs out. If you have 20 battery, the action must be MOVE TO HOME to recharge.

REMEMBER, THE OUTPUT MUST ALWAYS HAVE THIS FORMAT.

PLAN: 
(AND GIVE THE PLAN WITH CORRECT FORMAT)
"

RESPONSE:
To solve this problem, let's analyze the requirements and battery constraints step by step:

**Battery Consumption:**
- Start: 100
- Each MOVE: -20
- Each EXPLAIN: -10
- RECHARGE: sets battery to 100, only at home

**Goals:**
- Visit la_libertad_guiando_al_pueblo
- Explain: guernica, el_3_de_mayo_de_1808, la_rendicion_de_breda, el_jardin_de_las_delicias, la_ultima_cena, la_persistencia_de_la_memoria, el_nacimiento_de_venus

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Start at home (battery 100).**
2. **Plan the most efficient route to visit and explain all required paintings, minimizing moves and recharges.**
3. **Each move costs 20, each explain costs 10.**
4. **You must return to home to recharge before battery is too low to continue.**
5. **Only visit la_libertad_guiando_al_pueblo (no need to explain it).**
6. **Explain the 7 paintings at their locations.**

**Let's assume the following order for efficiency (since no map is given, we will visit each goal location in sequence, then return to home to recharge only when necessary):**

- home → guernica → el_3_de_mayo_de_1808 → la_rendicion_de_breda → el_jardin_de_las_delicias → la_ultima_cena → la_persistencia_de_la_memoria → el_nacimiento_de_venus → la_libertad_guiando_al_pueblo → home (if needed for recharge)

**Battery calculation:**

- home → guernica: move (-20) = 80
- explain guernica (-10) = 70
- move to el_3_de_mayo_de_1808 (-20) = 50
- explain el_3_de_mayo_de_1808 (-10) = 40
- move to la_rendicion_de_breda (-20) = 20
- explain la_rendicion_de_breda (-10) = 10

At this point, battery is 10. Can't move (need 20). Must return to home to recharge before battery is too low. But can't move with 10. So, after explaining la_rendicion_de_breda, battery is 10, can't move. So, after explaining el_3_de_mayo_de_1808, battery is 40, move to home (-20) = 20, recharge.

But that would mean not explaining la_rendicion_de_breda yet. So, let's try to optimize:

**Option 1: After explaining la_rendicion_de_breda, battery is 10, can't move. So, after explaining el_3_de_mayo_de_1808, battery is 40, move to home (-20) = 20, recharge. Then go to la_rendicion_de_breda.**

But that would require extra moves. Let's see if we can do more before recharging.

**Option 2: Try to do 2 explains and 2 moves before recharge:**

- home → guernica: move (-20) = 80
- explain guernica (-10) = 70
- move to el_3_de_mayo_de_1808 (-20) = 50
- explain el_3_de_mayo_de_1808 (-10) = 40
- move to home (-20) = 20
- recharge

Then continue.

**So, the plan is:**
- home → guernica (move, explain)

PROMPT:

You are a planner for PDDL and I only want you to give me the execution plan. You need to take into account the following:

1.The robot has a battery that is consumed with each movement and action.
2.The battery must be recharged when necessary, but you should minimize the number of recharges and movements to make the plan as efficient as possible.
3.Maximize efficiency regarding battery usage, performing recharges only when absolutely necessary and only at locations that have chargers.
4.Do not make any comments or additional explanations. I only want the plan.
5.Do not invent actions or make unnecessary actions.

I will provide you with the domain and the problem. The only output I expect from you is the execution plan, as a set of actions, with their start times and durations. The structure of the plan should be the following:

0.000: (start_welcome tiago) [1.000]
1.001: (move tiago home maestro_aprendiz) [15.000]
16.002: (move tiago maestro_aprendiz elgrito) [15.000]
31.002: (explain_painting tiago elgrito) [15.000]
46.002: (move tiago elgrito guernica) [15.000]
...
Now I will provide the domain and the problem. ONLY RESPOND WITH THE PLAN, NOTHING ELSE.

The most important thing in the plan is that you consider the battery.
Starting with 100, moving consumes 20, and explaining consumes 10. Therefore, you must recharge the robot before the battery runs out. If you have 20 battery, the action must be MOVE TO HOME to recharge.

REMEMBER, THE OUTPUT MUST ALWAYS HAVE THIS FORMAT.

0.000: (start_welcome tiago) [1.000]

Give me de step by step explanation of when you should recharge de robot, when you are planning and explaining a painting,
tell me why you are explaining the drawing and if it was in the goal or not.

MODEL : gpt-4o-mini
PROMPT:

You are a planner for PDDL and I only want you to give me the execution plan. You need to take into account the following:

1.The robot has a battery that is consumed with each movement and action.
2.The battery must be recharged when necessary, but you should minimize the number of recharges and movements to make the plan as efficient as possible.
3.Maximize efficiency regarding battery usage, performing recharges only when absolutely necessary and only at locations that have chargers.
4.Do not make any comments or additional explanations. I only want the plan.
5.Do not invent actions or make unnecessary actions.

I will provide you with the domain and the problem. The only output I expect from you is the execution plan, as a set of actions, with their start times and durations. The structure of the plan should be the following:

0.000: (start_welcome tiago) [1.000]
1.001: (move tiago home maestro_aprendiz) [15.000]
16.002: (move tiago maestro_aprendiz elgrito) [15.000]
31.002: (explain_painting tiago elgrito) [15.000]
46.002: (move tiago elgrito guernica) [15.000]
...
Now I will provide the domain and the problem. ONLY RESPOND WITH THE PLAN, NOTHING ELSE.

The most important thing in the plan is that you consider the battery.
Starting with 100, moving consumes 20, and explaining consumes 10. Therefore, you must recharge the robot before the battery runs out. If you have 20 battery, the action must be MOVE TO HOME to recharge.

REMEMBER, THE OUTPUT MUST ALWAYS HAVE THIS FORMAT.

You are a planner for PDDL and I only want you to give me the execution plan. You need to take into account the following:

1.The robot has a battery that is consumed with each movement and action.
2.The battery must be recharged when necessary, but you should minimize the number of recharges and movements to make the plan as efficient as possible.
3.Maximize efficiency regarding battery usage, performing recharges only when absolutely necessary and only at locations that have chargers.
4.Do not make any comments or additional explanations. I only want the plan.
5.Do not invent actions or make unnecessary actions.

I will provide you with the domain and the problem. The only output I expect from you is the execution plan, as a set of actions, with their start times and durations. The structure of the plan should be the following:

0.000: (start_welcome tiago) [1.000]
1.001: (move tiago home maestro_aprendiz) [15.000]

The most important thing in the plan is that you consider the battery.
Starting with 100, moving consumes 20, and explaining consumes 10. Therefore, you must recharge the robot before the battery runs out. If you have 20 battery, the action must be MOVE TO HOME to recharge.

REMEMBER, THE OUTPUT MUST ALWAYS HAVE THIS FORMAT.

The most important thing in the plan is that you consider the battery.
Starting with 100, moving consumes 20, and explaining consumes 10. Therefore, you must recharge the robot before the battery runs out. If you have 20 battery, the action must be MOVE TO HOME to recharge.

REMEMBER, THE OUTPUT MUST ALWAYS HAVE THIS FORMAT.

0.000: (start_welcome tiago) [1.000]
1.001: (move tiago home maestro_aprendiz) [15.000]
16.002: (move tiago maestro_aprendiz elgrito) [15.000]
31.002: (explain_painting tiago elgrito) [15.000]
46.002: (move tiago elgrito guernica) [15.000]


Give me de step by step explanation of when you should recharge de robot, when you are planning and explaining a painting,
tell me why you are explaining the drawing and if it was in the goal or not.

PLAN: 
(AND GIVE THE PLAN WITH CORRECT FORMAT)

RESPONSE:
The plan is designed to be as efficient as possible, minimizing movements and recharges by carefully managing the robot's battery. The robot, Tiago, starts with 100 battery units at `home`, the only charging location. A `move` costs 20 units and an `explain_painting` costs 10.

The strategy involves executing "tours" where Tiago leaves `home`, completes as many tasks as possible, and returns to recharge just as the battery is about to run out. An optimal tour involves using exactly 100 battery units, which typically allows for visiting three locations, explaining two paintings, and then returning to `home`.

**Tour 1:**
The robot begins by traveling to `maestro_aprendiz` and `elgrito`.
- **Why explain at `maestro_aprendiz` and `elgrito`?** These actions are performed because `(explained_painting maestro_aprendiz)` and `(explained_painting elgrito)` are required goals in the problem definition. The robot explains them upon arrival to be efficient.
- After these tasks, the robot moves to `guernica`, leaving it with 20 battery units.
- **When to recharge?** The robot must recharge now. With only 20 battery, it has just enough energy for one final `move`. To avoid being stranded, this move must be back to `home`. Upon arrival with 0 battery, it recharges to 100.

**Tour 2:**
With a full battery, the robot starts its second tour.
- It first travels to `guernica` to fulfill the `(explained_painting guernica)` goal, which couldn't be done in the previous tour due to low battery.
- It then proceeds to `la_joven_de_la_perla` and explains it, as this is another required goal.
- Following the same battery logic, after moving to `las_meninas`, the battery is down to 20, necessitating a return trip to `home` for a second recharge.

**Tour 3:**
This tour continues the pattern.
- Tiago leaves `home` to accomplish the goals of explaining at `las_meninas` and `el_3_de_mayo_de_1808`, as both were specified in the problem's goal state.
- After a final move to `el_jardin_de_las_delicias`, the battery is again at the critical 20-unit level, forcing a return to `home` for the third recharge.

**Final Tour:**
The last set of tasks is completed in this tour.
- The remaining goals are to explain at `el_jardin_de_las_delicias` and `monalisa`, and to visit `monalisa` and `nocheestrellada`. All of these are part of the problem's goal definition.
- The robot travels to `el_jardin_de_las_delicias` and `monalisa`, explaining at both locations.
- After explaining at `monalisa`, the battery is at 40. This is enough for two more moves. The final goal is to visit `nocheestrellada`, so the robot moves there directly, completing all objectives. The plan ends with the robot at `nocheestrellada`, as no further actions are required.
